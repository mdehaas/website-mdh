Any double quotes (`"`) or backslashes (e.g. LaTeX `\times`) occurring within the value of any frontmatter parameter (such as the *abstract*) should be escaped with a backslash (`\`). For example, the symbol `"` and LaTeX text `\times` become `\"` and `\\times`, respectively. Refer to the [TOML documentation](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-string) for more info.
