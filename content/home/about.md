# Introduction
I'm Marcel de Haas, 36 years old. I live in the Netherlands in a small town near the northern city of [Groningen](https://goo.gl/maps/Kz8HxKHEPdr).

I have been working in various IT functions since 2001. All this time I have worked with Microsoft Windows operating systems, mainly on the server side.

Last few years I've worked as technical specialist for a office automation in the cloud provider mainly focussing on server management in general and file server management as a specialism.
